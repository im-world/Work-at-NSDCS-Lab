Develop set of vector/point manipulation functions and replace
everywhere. (Bin)

Use signal names from the technology file. Right now they are hard
coded everywhere. For example: DATA, ADDR, etc.

Cell name (ms_flop) is hard coded in characterizer, pin names are hard
coded too. This should come from the config file which dynamically
loads the module names.

Autodetect ideal number of threads for hspice.

vdd and gnd are hard coded in some places. The names should come from
the tech file.

Some modules use upper/lower via layer instead of min width DRC rule
from tech file.

Fix the size of labels. For some reason, they are HUGE. (Samira)

Add the clock buffer internal to control logic. Simulation uses
1-4-8-16 inverters right now.  Replace simulation with simple clock
buffer after fixing.

Check out the multibank organization in sram.py and bank.py to see if
it can be reduced or made more readable.

Move/modify similar functions in hierarchical_predecode2x4 and 
hierarchical_predecode3x8 to hierarchical_predecode class

Fix stimuli.py to be more readable.

Add tests for bitcell, ms_flop, replica_bitcell, sens_amp, tri_gate, write_driver?
