\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
This paper introduced OpenRAM, an open-source and portable memory
compiler. OpenRAM generates the circuit, functional model, and layout
of variable-sized SRAMs. In addition, a memory characterizer
provides synthesis timing/power models.

The main motivation behind OpenRAM is to promote and simplify
memory-related research in academia. Since OpenRAM is open-sourced,
flexible, and portable, this memory compiler can be adapted to various
technologies and is easily modified to address specific design
requirements. Therefore, OpenRAM provides a platform to implement and test
new memory designs.

Designs are currently being fabricated to test designs using the
OpenRAM framework in SCMOS. We are also continuously introducing new
features, such as non-6T memories, variability characterization,
word-line segmenting, characterization speed-up, and a graphical user
interface (GUI). We hope to engage an active community in the future
development of OpenRAM.
