Computer systems research is often inhibited by the availability of
memory designs. Existing Process Design Kits (PDKs) frequently lack
memory compilers, while expensive commercial solutions only provide
memory models with immutable cells, limited configurations, and
restrictive licenses. Manually creating memories can be time consuming
and tedious and the designs are usually inflexible. This paper
introduces OpenRAM, an open-source memory compiler, that provides a
platform for the generation, characterization, and verification of
fabricable memory designs across various technologies, sizes, and
configurations. It enables research in computer architecture,
system-on-chip design, memory circuit and device research, and
computer-\allowbreak aided design.
